#SwineMeeper

What do you get when you switch around the letters in Minesweeper?  That's right, it's SwineMeeper- the classic game you didn't know was a classic.  Your pigs have all gone crazy and are hiding in their pen.  Click to clean the pen, flag (right-click) where you think there's a pig, and be careful not to click where you think there's a pig hiding!  The numbers help indiciate what's lurking in their vicinity.  Once all pig locations have been identified and the pigpen has been cleared away, you've successfully Meeped your Swine! (Meeping is a farming term which you hadn't heard of until now because you're not a farmer).
